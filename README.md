# Mindustry code compiler

A code compiler that converts readable code into Mindustry-compatible mess that can be copy-pasted into the processors.

This is Jakob's project, thank him for the idea and code.

Future ideas:
* Flexible interface
* Built in tutorial and examples
* A code browser like the mod browser in-game
* Mindustry mod to run and test entirely in-game since this is all JS anyway)
